        I think im surprisingly enjoying some parts of quaratine or self isolation, <br>
        quarantine sounds more alarming. Im watching more films especially independent <br>
        films which I have been trying to watch more of. It's nice taking care of the <br>
        plants I have, I was trying to grow basil, it came up to about an inch, and <br>
        then died on me. Im really enjoying being with myself, listening to a lot of <br>
        music... not reading books, still not there yet. It's actually nice to put my <br>
        phone down, not speak to anyone for a while, a sort of meditative experience even <br>
        if im looking for a fancier term to describe all this.
