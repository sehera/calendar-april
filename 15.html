        It was mainly a work day today. Did some research and worked on my typography project. <br>
        It's been quite fun and interesting. I went over my classes for next semester and I am <br>
        really excited about my editorial studio class!

        I also cooked today, which was quite hard. Tried to make a dish, one of my moms recipes <br>
        didn't taste <b> anything </b> like the actual dish. But close enough, I was quite happy about <br>
        it, atleast it looked good :)

        I made a list of movies, I really want to watch. Now is a great time for that. I watched <br>
        LadyBird and it was very unique in many ways. I want to watch SO MANY FILMS,<br>
        I cannot keep count.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also looked over sites... editorial or sites with design I really REALLY liked. I've been <br>
        looking at websites for design inspiration for print work now too, I didn't do<br>
        so before, but it's quite helpful.
