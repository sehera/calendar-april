        Quarantine or self isolation for such a long time is something I never <br>
        thought I would experience. It's been reflective & very new. The positives <br>
        are harder to think of but there always are some.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Just a few things I can think of right now...
      </p>

      <p>
        a lot of time, to think, and be with myself
      </p>

      <p>
        started writing like I've wanted to for a while, in a book too not the computer.
      </p>

      <p>
        made my own at home coffee "concoction" that I love
      </p>

      <p>
        a lot of cooking and new cooking skills. very surprising
      </p>

      <p>
        got more plants to take care of
      </p>

      <p>
        learnt more about myself, the good and bad
      </p>

      <p>
        taking time to do, slowly, changes everything
      </p>

      <p>
        peaceful when I forget about what's happening outside my bubble
      </p>
